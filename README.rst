===================
django-calendardate
===================

*A calendar model with date metadata for querying against.*

Sometimes it is useful to have a range of dates and associated metadata stored in the database, rather than calculating on-the-fly, particularly when creating reports based on quarters, fiscal years, etc. This is where django-calendardate comes in. Also known as a date dimension table or calendar table, the inspiration for this project comes from `this article <https://www.sqlshack.com/designing-a-calendar-table/>`_.

django-calendardate provides:

* a model for storing metadata about a set of dates.
* a management command for generating the metadata


THIS PROJECT IS PRE_RELEASE. It works, but is missing documentation and tests. Be cautious.

Coming soon.
